I am working on taking over ML and AI by accelerating the tree traversals. Of course not, I'm just kidding! Or maybe not - you never know  ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯. 
							My actual research interests span Parallel Computing, High-Performance Computing, Databases, and Compilers. I'm working on mapping applications to a particular tree traversal interfaced by Ray-Tracing cores of Nvidia GPUs.
