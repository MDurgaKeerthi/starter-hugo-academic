I am working on taking over ML and AI by accelerating the tree traversals. Of course not, I'm just kidding! Or maybe not - you never know  ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯. 

My actual research interests span Parallel Computing, High-Performance Computing, Databases, and Compilers. I'm working on mapping applications to a particular tree traversal accelerated by Ray-Tracing cores of Nvidia GPUs. <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/" target="_blank">Prof. Milind Kulkarni</a> is my Ph.D. advisor. 

In the summer 2022, I interned at <a href="https://katanagraph.ai/" target="_blank">Katana Graph</a>, where I had the opportunity to work with <a href="https://roshandathathri.github.io/" target="_blank">Roshan Dathathri</a> on accelerating random walks on graphs. Before coming to Purdue, I did my undergrad in Computer Science & Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India. I was also at Simon Fraser Univerity, Vancouver, Canada briefly during the summer 2019 for MITACS internship. Thanks to <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~keval/" target="_blank">Prof. Keval Vora</a>, I had an amazing experience building a scalable solution to process computations on streaming graphs.
